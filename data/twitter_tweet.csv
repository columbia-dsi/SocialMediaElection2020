Donald Trump,How many facts can one Democrat get wrong in under two minutes of testimony?
Donald Trump,Democrats continue to move the goalposts and stubbornly defy the standard they once set for themselves.
Donald Trump,No collusion. No obstruction. No pressure. No pushing. No quid pro quo. No nothing!
Donald Trump,The Democrats' legislative record pales in comparison to @realDonaldTrump's three-year record as Commander in Chief.
Donald Trump,@realDonaldTrump has consistently cooperated with this Congress in fulfilling its oversight &amp
Donald Trump,The elected President sets the policy for the unelected bureaucrats.
Donald Trump,Not the other way around.
Donald Trump,The President put America first by ensuring U.S. taxpayer dollars weren't funding Ukrainian corruption.
Donald Trump,Today's impeachment markup has confirmed our worst fears
Donald Trump,I guess we now know why Nancy Pelosi was focus-grouping bribery as a potential charge. Because she was desperately sear…
Joe Biden,President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes — and we’re all paying the price. We must get him out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat it is.
Joe Biden,"We must restore our nation's commitment to humane and effective immigration policies. As president, I'll provide a fair and just system that helps to grow and enhance our economy, and secure our  cherished values."
Joe Biden,"The one truly sacred obligation our government has is to properly train and equip the men and women who defend our nation at war and to care for them and their families—while they’re deployed, and after they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation."
Joe Biden,"What kind of president bullies a teenager? @realDonaldTrump, you could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader."
Joe Biden,"Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite indisputable evidence. And it again confirms that he's incapable of real leadership."
Joe Biden,I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one—and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. It’s time to put an end to Trump’s shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance.
Joe Biden,@DrBiden and I are keeping those affected by this hate-filled attack in our hearts. We cannot be silent in the face of anti-Semitism. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry and to give hate no safe harbor.
Joe Biden,Being a nation of immigrants has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity makes us stronger. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
Joe Biden,"Immigration has always made us stronger—it’s essential to who we are. But Donald Trump has waged an assault on our values as a nation of immigrants. As president, I'll undo Trump’s damage and put our values back at the heart of our immigration system:"
Joe Biden,Folks are coming together across the country to host watch parties for next week's Democratic debate! Head to https://joe.link/35caMtB to sign up to host one in your community.
Elizabeth Warren,I join the Armenian American community in MA & the rest of the Armenian diaspora in celebrating the Senate passage of a resolution recognizing the #ArmenianGenocide. I cosponsored S.Res.150 to recognize this tragedy. It has been far too long.
Elizabeth Warren,"Taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay the legal bills of a private company, and the government shouldn’t protect a private prison carrying out inhumane immigration policies – especially one that bats its eyelashes from the Trump Hotel lobby."
Elizabeth Warren,"The NDAA does nothing to end our disastrous and inhumane support for Saudi ops in Yemen, nothing to prevent a war with Iran, and permits the deployment of a destabilizing low yield nuke weapon. For that and 738 billion other reasons, I don’t support the bill."
Elizabeth Warren,The Pentagon’s budget has been too large for too long. I cannot support a defense bill that’s a $738 billion Christmas present to giant defense contractors & undermines our values and security.
Elizabeth Warren,"Pete Frates challenged us all to fight harder for a cure to ALS – & in doing so he inspired the world. My heart goes out to Pete’s wife, daughter, family & friends in MA & across the US. Let’s remember him by keeping up the fight for the people we love."
Elizabeth Warren,"Few people have had more impact on our modern financial system than the great Paul Volcker. For more than 5 decades, he fought for more robust, efficient, & effective rules to keep the US economy safe. I’m very sorry for his loss."
Elizabeth Warren,"Caroll Spinney was a beloved friend to millions of children & families who never knew his name — and a beloved son of Waltham & Acton, MA. My thoughts are with Mr. Spinney’s family & the entire @SesameStreet community. His voice lives on in all of us."
Elizabeth Warren,"I’m sick & tired of giant drug companies prioritizing profits over patients’ health. Greedy Gilead execs should not be able to abuse the patent system to get rich from #PrEP, & we need to take steps to open the pharmaceutical market to more competition."
Elizabeth Warren,Servicemembers & their families deserve high-quality health care. I’m glad @DeptofDefense will start to cover 3D breast cancer screenings in the military health system. Earlier this year I urged DOD & cosponsored a bipartisan bill to require coverage of this preventive screening.
Elizabeth Warren,"I’m very glad the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to permanently fund HBCUs and other minority-serving colleges, which I was proud to cosponsor. These schools have waited for funding certainly long enough – the House should pass the #FUTUREAct right away."
Bernie Sanders,"In just over 50 days, the first votes will be cast to decide the Democratic nominee. We are in a position to win. Campaign manager @fshakir is joining us live now to give a campaign update and to answer your questions:"
Bernie Sanders,IN ~20 MINUTES: Our Campaign Manager @fshakir will be coming to you live from New Hampshire with an update on the campaign. Tune in!
Bernie Sanders,"We have an opportunity to tell our grandkids that we took on one of the greatest challenges humanity has seen, defeated the wealth and power of the fossil fuel industry, and created 20 million jobs and a 100% renewable energy system."
Bernie Sanders,We are not only going to legalize marijuana; we are going to expunge past convictions for marijuana possession. Thank you to @KimFoxxforSA for leading the way on this important issue.
Bernie Sanders,Not every candidate is prepared to stand up to the outrageous greed of the drug companies and the insurance companies. I promise you that I am.
Bernie Sanders,"Are you ready for a really, really radical idea? People in the richest country on Earth shouldn't have to take fish antibiotics to save money. Medicare for All now."
Bernie Sanders,I don't think Democrats should be using health insurance industry talking points to scare Americans about Medicare for All. The bottom line: Medicare for All will save the average American thousands of dollars a year and guarantee comprehensive coverage to all.
Bernie Sanders,Incremental change is not enough. We are going to enact a Green New Deal because we have no other option if we want to save our planet.
Bernie Sanders,To my opponents who want to maintain the status quo in our health care system: How can you defend a system that makes billions for health insurance companies while bankrupting the American people?
Bernie Sanders,"Maybe I am the radical one, but I don’t believe that in the United States of America parents should have “medical debt” when they leave the hospital with their new baby."
Pete Buttigieg,"Cities like mine know what a minor league baseball team can mean to an economy, a culture, and even a childhood. That is what's at stake for the heartland if @MLB overhauls the minor league. Do the right thing. Save our teams."
Pete Buttigieg,"Thank you @GretaThunberg for speaking the truth, demanding we listen, and bringing people from different generations, backgrounds, and nations together to combat climate catastrophe."
Pete Buttigieg,My deepest condolences are with the family of Detective Seals and all who lost loved ones during the shooting at a Kosher market in Jersey City. Gun violence has created a national security crisis. We must act urgently to combat rising hate and secure our communities.
Pete Buttigieg,"One year ago today, China arbitrarily imprisoned Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. China has also targeted innocent Americans with cruel and unjustified exit bans. From Dandong to Xinjiang, China's human rights violations must come to an end."
Pete Buttigieg,"Transparency and integrity are qualities the American people should expect from their president. I intend to bring those values with me to the Oval Office, and today I’m releasing details of my work history while honoring my word."
Pete Buttigieg,"The promise we make in America is that every child should have access to an education that will give them the power to live a life of their choosing. Today I'm proud to announce an education plan that centers on students, teachers, and parents."
Pete Buttigieg,"Now more than ever, the American people deserve transparency from their president. I’m urging McKinsey to do the right thing, and in the meantime, I’m providing a summary of my work."
Pete Buttigieg,"""For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me."""
Pete Buttigieg,"“An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his constituents.”  —Alexander Hamilton"
Pete Buttigieg,"I will be a commander in chief who knows what it means to be sent abroad on the orders of a president—one who will keep America’s promise to those who've kept theirs. Thank you, @VoteVets. It is an honor to have your endorsement."
Kamala Harris,"Don’t worry, Mr. President. I’ll see you at your trial."
Kamala Harris,The House will vote on two articles of impeachment against the President: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Make no mistake: Trump will continue to tweet lies until then. We know the truth—he is our greatest national security threat and must be held accountable.
Kamala Harris,He has separated families.Locked children in cages. Attempted to end protections for Dreamers. Tried to spend billions on a wasteful border wall. These disastrous and cruel policies must come to an end.
Kamala Harris,The Attorney General swears an oath to serve and protect the Constitution—not the President. Bill Barr must come before the Senate to testify under oath.
Kamala Harris,"We don’t have to live like this. Our towns shouldn’t become war zones, our schools on one lockdown after another. It has never been more urgent that we take action on gun violence and stop this epidemic."
Kamala Harris,Three children have died from the flu. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last year that detained migrants were vaccinated against the flu.Yet Trump and his henchmen continue to reject offers from doctors for help.
Kamala Harris,"Recently released emails clearly show what is driving Stephen Miller. It’s not national security, it’s white supremacy—something that has no place in our country, federal government, and especially not the White House. He must go."
Kamala Harris,Technology has connected us like never before—making it even easier for abusive partners to perpetrate digital domestic violence. Survivors deserve our support to end this cycle.
Kamala Harris,"Our teachers shouldn’t have to learn how to tackle a gunman as part of teacher orientation. By turning a blind eye to the gun violence epidemic in exchange for a payout from the @NRA, Republicans in Congress have failed our teachers and students."
Kamala Harris,"We’ve placed a societal value on jobs that require a college education, while devaluing the jobs that don’t.In a Harris Administration, we’ll invest in programs that match the demand for trade jobs."
Andrew Yang,"I’m not running for president because I fantasized about being president; I’m running for president because, like many of you here . . . I’m a parent & a patriot and I have seen the future that we are leaving for our kids & it is not something I am willing to accept.#DemDebate"
Andrew Yang,"#YangGang, we need to raise $2 million by midnight on Sunday and we need your help! Donate now and let's show them we are the team to beat!"
Andrew Yang,Wonderful meeting Iowans at the Ames office opening!
Andrew Yang,"I think Bernie, Cory, and the other senators should feel free to campaign during the impeachment trial if it comes to that. They know enough to know which way they would vote and can always get briefed on new findings."
Andrew Yang,When I was a kid I worried about what my peers thought of me. Then I realized that people think much more about their own stuff than someone else’s.
Andrew Yang,#1 in small donors. Grassroots funding. No corporate PAC money.  That’s the #YangGang. This campaign is all about people fighting for other people.
Andrew Yang,While we're working on the audio we'll be calling donors! Donate now and we might call you!
Andrew Yang,Great talking with Kennedy High School students in Cedar Rapids about climate change.  We need to make big moves to safeguard our communities and people.
Andrew Yang,We'll be livestreaming from the bus tonight! We might even make a few phone calls to those who have donated today- donate now and you never know! http://Yang2020.com
Andrew Yang,I’ve been asked what I think about Iowa’s outsized role in the presidential nomination process. I like Iowans. I find them to have a ton of common sense. They elevated Barack Obama in ‘08 - they have demonstrated an ability to judge based on who would move the country forward.
Amy Klobuchar,I don’t quite yet have $100 million for an ad buy this month but I could make up for it if you retweet this. Thanks everyone. And if you like it you can also help us out at http://amyklobuchar.com
Amy Klobuchar,Four more years of Donald Trump would permanently weaken our country and the world is watching us closely. We cannot afford to lose this election.
Amy Klobuchar,The shooter in Jersey City posted anti-Semitic writings online before killing six people. Hatred and violence go hand in hand — neither have a place in our society.
Amy Klobuchar,"We need a new commander in chief.Someone who can command with stability and strength.Someone who can respond to the great challenges of our time.Someone who can stand with our allies, protect our interests and work to build a more just world."
Amy Klobuchar,"This is outrageous. Betsy DeVos is denying justice to over 200K students defrauded by for-profit colleges, making excuses for deceptive business practices instead of fixing problems. As President, my Education Dept will work FOR students, not against them."
Amy Klobuchar,More John Deere layoffs will hit Iowa as a result of Donald Trump's destructive trade war. Hard-working Americans are bearing the brunt of his shortsighted economic policies. Our farmers and rural businesses deserve better than this.
Amy Klobuchar,We need to reassert the American values that have always been at the heart of our foreign policy but this President has discarded. And that starts right here at home — we must stop the fear-mongering and the hate. We all live in the same country of shared dreams.
Amy Klobuchar,Just questioned the DOJ Inspector General at the Judiciary Committee hearing. He made clear there was no political bias in opening the Russia investigation & nothing contradicts the fact that Russia interfered in our election. We need to take action now to protect our elections.
Amy Klobuchar,"As President, I will restore America’s leadership in the world, repair our alliances, rejoin int'l agreements, respond to global challenges/threats & reassert American values.Sharing my foreign policy vision w/ @CFR_org now. Watch the livestream here"
Amy Klobuchar,What better way to announce we hit ten percent in Iowa poll than via the coach of the Olympic gold medal curling team.  He gets momentum...on the ice and off. And thanks to my “gold medal” campaign team!
Cory Booker,Building a campaign to win begins with the Iowa caucuses on February 3rd. And I can’t do this alone. I’m asking for your help—please chip in to make sure we have the ground game we need to compete:
Cory Booker,I’m not sticking around for vanity or ego—I’m in this to win it because I believe I’m the best candidate to beat Donald Trump and lead this country to higher ground.
Cory Booker,We need a leader in the Oval Office who’s able to unite our deeply divided nation and begin the healing our country so desperately needs. It’s time for a president who brings us together as one nation—not one who drives us apart with hate and fear.
Cory Booker,"My entire career I've brought people together to take on our toughest challenges. I beat slumlords taking advantage of low-income families, ushered in Newark’s greatest economic growth in a generation, and overcame Washington's broken politics to pass criminal justice reform."
Cory Booker,"I’ll be doing what we’ve done for the last ten months of this campaign and throughout my time in public service—meeting people where they are, in living rooms and church basements, at coffee shops and in diners, and discussing how to tackle the most pressing challenges we face."
Cory Booker,"The voters deserve to decide who the Democratic nominee should be, and I know that together, we can win this race. Next week, I’ll be on the road hearing directly from and sharing my vision with the people who will determine the outcome of this race—the way it should be."
Cory Booker,"Today is the deadline for the DNC's December debate qualifying threshold—and while I may not be on the debate stage next Thursday, thanks to the outpouring of support over the past few weeks, we know there’s a path to victory, and we no longer need the debate stage to get there."
Cory Booker,"We need a commander-in-chief who will lead with our values and restore America's standing in the world. That means working closely with our allies again, rebuilding our diplomatic corps, and supporting our troops—both at home and abroad."
Cory Booker,"In America, 1 in 6 renting households spend more than half of their monthly income on rent. We have a housing crisis and we need a radical plan to ensure people are able to access this basic human right."
Cory Booker,"Closely monitoring the active shooter situation in Jersey City. For folks in the area, please continue to avoid Martin Luther King Drive for now.—it's not safe.Grateful for the first responders who quickly arrived on the scene, and praying for the officers shot in the standoff."
Tulsi Gabbard,"The Afghanistan War has been a gravy train for military contractors, corrupt politicians & warlords. My new bill will call for a congressional investigation. It's time for accountability. As president, I commit to immediately bring our troops home, complete within a few months."
Tulsi Gabbard,"I honor the vision of our country’s founders embodied in the Constitution & Bill of Rights, of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. As president, I'll turn our founders’ vision into reality—that’s why the powerful elite is afraid of me. @GovMikeHuckabee"
Tulsi Gabbard,"We spend $4 billion every month on a war in Afghanistan. How can we look our veterans in the eye & tell them we have no money for their healthcare? As president, I’ll work to end these wars, bring our troops home, & treat our veterans with the respect they deserve.#TULSI2020"
Tulsi Gabbard,"For a number of reasons, I have decided not to attend the December 19th ""debate"" — regardless of whether or not there are qualifying polls. I instead choose to spend that precious time directly meeting with and hearing from the people of New Hampshire and South Carolina."
Tulsi Gabbard,"Why is Trump acting as the spokesperson for Saudi Arabia? It is a disgrace that the office of the presidency is being used for the interests of the theocratic extremist Saudi Arabian Kingdom, the #1 exporter of the radical Islamist ideology that fuels jihadists like al-Qaeda/ISIS"
Tulsi Gabbard,"“Primary voters have always had special appreciation for veteran candidates, & that’s why voters are giving Tulsi a look. They admire her service…& anyone watching the race knows this candidate doesn’t back down from a fight."" Great interview on New Hampshire evening news WMUR"
Tulsi Gabbard,My heart and condolences are with the victims of this tragic shooting and their families. I join the people of Hawaii in expressing our thanks to law enforcement and first responders who rushed to secure the area and get people to safety.
Tulsi Gabbard,"Rather than debate the wisdom of US military intervention in foreign countries, those who profit from these wars smear me with “foreign agent” lies. I will usher in a new foreign policy that is in our country’s best interests and allows us to be force for good in the world."
Tulsi Gabbard,"Sending my best wishes to @KamalaHarris, her family & supporters who have campaigned so hard. While we disagree on some issues, we agree on others & I respect her sincere desire to serve the American people. I look forward to working together on the challenges we face as a nation"
Tulsi Gabbard,"I will always treat you with respect and compassion, which in Hawaii we call Aloha. Everyone deserves such respect no matter their race, gender, religion, or politics. Working side-by-side, let's usher in a future of peace, human dignity, and true equality.#TULSI2020"
Tom Steyer,"Our system isn’t working because it’s been corrupted by corporate influence, a lack of transparency, and partisan efforts to suppress voices and votes. A Steyer administration will move away from business as usual and toward tangible structural reform."
Tom Steyer,It is inhumane and unthinkable that our government would deport those who represent the very best of who we are. The outpouring of support for Jesus from the community is a testament to the way in which he positively impacted the lives of those around him.
Tom Steyer,Deeply saddened by the shootings in Jersey City. Hate and anti-semitism have no place in our country and I call on all Americans to speak out and denounce this disturbing trend in our society—we owe it to victims and their families.
Tom Steyer,". @gretathunberg is absolutely right. The inaction accompanied by business as usual will lead to our demise. On day one of my presidency, I'll declare climate change a national emergency and use the full powers of the executive office to help save our only planet."
Tom Steyer,African Americans are long overdue for equality and equity in this country. Reparations are only the tip of the iceberg.
Tom Steyer,Deanna Berry is a hero of mine because of her unwavering commitment to fight for clean water and environmental justice in her community. Rural America needs and deserves a constant ally. This country needs a president who understands that.
Tom Steyer,"This blue wave is not fake news. “When Trump was inaugurated, there were 241 Republicans in the House. With the retirement of Florida Rep. Ted Yoho on Tuesday, 104 of them have either retired, been defeated or are not running again in 2020.”"
Tom Steyer,"""...we care about having a president who takes seriously his oath to preserve and protect our Constitution. Without that, we will end up one day morally and financially bankrupt."""
Tom Steyer,"Anyone who’s making the climate crisis their second or third priority is kidding themselves. Our planet is nearing the point of no return. We’ve got to save the world, and we’ve got to do it together."
Tom Steyer,"It's a no-brainer—@realdonaldtrump is a criminal who puts himself over his country. The millions of Americans who marched, voted, and called Congress to impeach have known it for over two years. Glad Congress is doing the right thing."
