candidate,post
Donald Trump,Working families have found their biggest advocates in the Trump Administration. We will never stop fighting for you!
Donald Trump,"PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!"
Donald Trump,"Polling is looking really bad for impeachment-obsessed Democrats, so they’re rushing an already unfair process. This is a disgrace to our country. They don’t want the American people to decide the election!"
Donald Trump,"I also have constantly asked, “Why aren’t Germany, France and other European countries helping Ukraine more? They are the biggest beneficiaries. Why is it always the good ol’ United States?” The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, never mention this at their phony hearing!"
Donald Trump,"Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad."
Joe Biden,The world is laughing at President Trump. They see him for what he really is: dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.We cannot give him four more years as commander in chief.
Joe Biden,President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes — and we’re all paying the price. We must get him out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat it is.
Joe Biden,"We must restore our nation's commitment to humane and effective immigration policies. As president, I'll provide a fair and just system that helps to grow and enhance our economy, and secure our cherished values."
Joe Biden,"The one truly sacred obligation our government has is to properly train and equip the men and women who defend our nation at war and to care for them and their families—while they’re deployed, and after they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation."
Joe Biden,"What kind of president bullies a teenager? Donald Trump, you could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader."
Elizabeth Warren,"Some candidates jet off to Manhattan or San Francisco for fancy fundraisers that cost more than $2,000 a ticket.Not me. We’re building our campaign one small-dollar donation at a time—because the presidency shouldn’t be bought by the wealthy and well-connected. Chip in $3 now to join us."
Elizabeth Warren,"We’re weeks away from the first caucuses and primaries. If a few more people on Facebook chip in tonight, we’ll be on track to grow our grassroots movement before voting begins.I’m deeply grateful for any amount you’re able to give."
Elizabeth Warren,"Some people dismiss any investment in middle-class families as “free stuff.”You know who's getting free stuff? Amazon, which had $10 billion in profits this year and is paying $0 in federal income taxes.Working families are paying their fair share—let’s invest in them."
Elizabeth Warren,"I don't sell access to my time. I don't do closed-door fundraisers. And I don't ask for a $1,000 contribution for a selfie. If you want to know about a candidate’s commitment to reform, don’t just look at what they say they will do—look at what they’re doing right now."
Elizabeth Warren,Wall Street executives and billionaires are spending their time and money attacking me—they believe I'm the biggest threat to a corrupt system that has enriched them at everyone else’s expense. They are right.I do have a plan to make real change.
Bernie Sanders,"Corporate-backed think tanks pretend that America’s obscene income inequality was inevitable. Technology, globalization and automation are responsible, they claim. There's nothing we can do to stop it. Well, the last time I checked, Western Europe also competes in the global economy, and they managed to keep their middle class.Make no mistake: inequality is a political choice. And when we stand up and fight for policies that empower working families and make the rich pay their fair share, we will create an economy that works for everyone—not just the top 1%."
Bernie Sanders,Mr. Trump and the GOP passed a tax scam two years ago. They said it would create jobs and boost wages.Big surprise: none of that happened—but who got richer? Their millionaire and billionaire donors.
Bernie Sanders,"I have long believed that democracy isn't just voting every four years—it’s about ordinary people creating community, engaging in the political process together, and building powerful grassroots movements to achieve progressive change. And that’s exactly what we’re doing."
Bernie Sanders,"Good. Now $1,685,456,413,335 more to go. Cancel all student debt and tax Wall Street to fund tuition-free public college."
Bernie Sanders,"We have people working 50, 60, 70 hours a week just to put food on the table, just to make sure that their families can live with a modicum of dignity. And the reason for all of that is that wages in the United States of America are just too low, and the time is long overdue for us to raise the minimum wage to a living wage."
Pete Buttigieg,"Thank you, Greta Thunberg, for speaking the truth, demanding we listen, and bringing people from different generations, backgrounds, and nations together to combat climate catastrophe.We cannot wait to act. I am with you. Change is coming."
Pete Buttigieg,More great news from the Granite State!
Pete Buttigieg,We cannot create an economy that works for all until we pave the way for Black entrepreneurs. My administration will make available $20 billion to empower America’s next job creators and unlock 3 million new jobs.
Pete Buttigieg,What we’re building in Iowa is bigger than this moment—it’s a movement.
Pete Buttigieg,Let’s build a country unified around bold solutions.
Kamala Harris,"Congress has failed the families and students of Newtown. Now, seven years later, the survivors of one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history are turning their pain into action."
Kamala Harris,The Attorney General swears an oath to serve and protect the Constitution—not the President. Bill Barr must come before the Senate to testify under oath.
Kamala Harris,"Recently released emails clearly show what is driving Stephen Miller. It’s not national security, it’s white supremacy—something that has no place in our country, federal government, and especially not the White House. He must go."
Kamala Harris,Greta Thunberg has proven that one voice can make a difference. Her leadership in the international fight for climate justice has inspired countless young people to take up the charge for a more sustainable future. I hope our current leadership is listening.
Kamala Harris,"To my supporters, it is with deep regret—but also with deep gratitude—that I am suspending my campaign today.But I want to be clear with you: I will keep fighting every day for what this campaign has been about. Justice for the People. All the people."

Amy Klobuchar,We need to reassert the American values that have always been at the heart of our foreign policy but this President has discarded.And that starts right here at home — we must stop the fear-mongering and the hate. We all live in the same country of shared dreams.
Amy Klobuchar,I stand with SEA / SEIU Local 1984 fighting for fair wages for New Hampshire workers. Governor Sununu should follow the independent fact-finder report and agree to a contract that shows Granite State workers the respect they deserve.I'm from a union family. As President I'll stand strong with unions.
Amy Klobuchar,"This is about my provision in the bipartisan House-passed Violence Against Women Act to close the boyfriend loophole so that convicted domestic abusers can’t get guns. The NRA opposes it, which means Mitch McConnell & Senate Republicans are holding it up. Call them and ask why.HPD chief Acevedo calls out McConnell, Cornyn, Cruz by name, urging them to pass Violence Against Women act.""And who killed our Sgt? A boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you're either here for women and children [daughters, sisters] and our aunts, or you're here for the NRA.""Video from Mark Mulligan, Photojournalist at Houston Chronicle."
Amy Klobuchar,"Like I said to the Teamsters: When unions are strong, America is strong."
Amy Klobuchar,"As I told Cosmopolitan: Yes, I would be the first woman president, but I don’t think that’s the reason to vote for me. I think the reason is that I have people’s backs. That I’m going to get things done and that I cannot just win but win big."
Cory Booker,"In America, 1 in 6 renting households spend more than half of their monthly income on rent. We have a housing crisis and we need a radical plan to ensure people are able to access this basic human right."
Cory Booker,"You should be able to afford health care for your family. You should be able to retire with dignity and respect. And you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream bigger, go farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine."
Cory Booker,Gun manufacturers should be held accountable for their role in our nation’s gun violence epidemic. We need to end legal immunity and help survivors of gun violence seek justice.
Cory Booker,There isn’t a single county in the US where a full-time worker making minimum wage can afford a 2-bedroom apartment at fair-market rent. That’s why we need to increase the supply of affordable units and pass a renters tax credit to ensure the basic right of housing for all.
Cory Booker,"We don't just need a candidate who can beat Donald Trump—we need a president who can make justice and opportunity real for every American.Please watch and share our campaign's newest ad, ""Common Cause""."
Tulsi Gabbard,"The Afghanistan War has been a gravy train for military contractors, corrupt politicians & warlords. My new bill will call for a congressional investigation. It's time for accountability. As president, I commit to immediately bring our troops home, complete within a few months."
Tulsi Gabbard,"I honor the vision of our country’s founders embodied in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. As president, I will turn our founders’ vision into reality—that’s why the powerful elite is afraid of me."
Tulsi Gabbard,"We spend $4 billion every month on a war in Afghanistan. How can we look our veterans in the eye & tell them we have no money for their healthcare? As president, I’ll work to end these wars, bring our troops home, & treat our veterans with the respect they deserve"
Tulsi Gabbard,"For a number of reasons, I have decided not to attend the December 19th ""debate"" — regardless of whether or not there are qualifying polls. I instead choose to spend that precious time directly meeting with and hearing from the people of New Hampshire and South Carolina."
Tulsi Gabbard,"_A Saudi lieutenant carried out a terrorist attack in Pensacola killing three service members and leaving eight others injured. Why is Trump acting as the spokesperson for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia? It is a disgrace and shameful that the office of the presidency is being used to further the interests of the theocratic extremist Saudi Arabian Kingdom, the #1 exporter and proponent of the radical Islamist ideology that fuels jihadists like al-Qaeda/ISIS_."
Tom Steyer,Ridiculous? Donald J. Trump must be referring to the mockery he’s made of the presidency.
Tom Steyer,Deeply saddened by the shootings in Jersey City. Hate and anti-semitism have no place in our country and I call on all Americans to speak out and denounce this disturbing trend in our society—we owe it to victims and their families.
Tom Steyer,"My family and I have always and continue to cherish the opportunity to do our part and leave our collective campsite cleaner and better tended than we found it. Today on #InternationalMountainDay, I implore you to step outside and remind yourself how much we have left to protect. The stakes are high, but if we work together, we absolutely can save the world."
Tom Steyer,"HBCUs were born out of injustice and the evils of slavery. As a part of my broader support for reparations, my administration would pledge 125B to these institutions to combat years of racial inequity."
Tom Steyer,"Rep Jerry Nadler is right. Donald Trump may have declined the invitation to testify, but his choice won't ""prevent us from carrying out our solemn constitutional duty.”"
