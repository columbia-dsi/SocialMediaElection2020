Vote American However, does every individual knows enough about the candidates that they have to choose from? Candidats 1.2 Trends A key part of the United States presidential campaigns is the use of media and framing. Candidates are able to frame their opponents and current issues in ways to affect the way voters will see events and the other presidential candidates. Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. Since the development of the internet in the mid-90s, Internet activism has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000. In 2008, the internet became a grassroots and a voice of the people tool. A study done by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the United States used the internet to get information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific candidates. Internet channels such as YouTube were used by candidates to share speeches and ads for free. This also served as a forum for users to attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.[1] A study done by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the United States used the internet to get information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific candidates. This represents 73 percent of adult internet users. The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used social network sites or Twitter to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.[2] With huge impact from often biased media, general public is often mislead by the media, and then we start to see suprises after elections. The presidency of Donald Trump began at noon EST on January 20, 2017, Among the 44 persons who have served as president, only Donald Trump had never held a position in either government or the military prior to taking office. In contrast to the 2016 presidential election, where social media was a novelty, the candidates for election in 2020 had carefully managed social media strategies. With the concerns of all those mysterious, we start a study using social media data to analyze current dem candidates status, and help people to understand the 2020 presidential polls. We use social media like youtube, twitter, facebook to address the impact of social media in the 2020 United States presidential election. 1.3 Project 1.3.1 The Team Haibo Yu - hy2628 Kevin Gao - wg2311 1.3.2 The Plan Haibo: 1.

Data analysis: Data exploration and visualization Kevin: 1. Data pipeline: Design, and architect the data flow and project details. 2. Data analysis: Data exploration and visualization 3. Data prediction*: Apply machine learning, NLP, GLM to make predictions of our data. 1.3.3 The Questions Here are main questions that we hope we will be able to answer from this research. 1.3.3.0.0.1 Core questions: In each state, which candidate has more popularity online, in terms of views, likes, retweets…etc ?
