Every once a while, the election will impact the U.S. in many aspects, such as job experience, income taxes, government investments and since U.S. plays a key role in golabal econemy, it cerntianly drive attention from every tax payer. Foundamentaly, today’s democracy allow every citizen can vote and every vote count as one. Vote American However, does every individual knows enough about the candidates that they have to choose from? Candidats 1.2 Trends A key part of the United States presidential campaigns is the use of media and framing. Candidates are able to frame their opponents and current issues in ways to affect the way voters will see events and the other presidential candidates. Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. Since the development of the internet in the mid-90s, Internet activism has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000. In 2008, the internet became a grassroots and a voice of the people tool. A study done by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the United States used the internet to get information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific candidates. Internet channels such as YouTube were used by candidates to share speeches and ads for free. This also served as a forum for users to attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.[1] A study done by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the United States used the internet to get information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific candidates. This represents 73 percent of adult internet users. The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used social network sites or Twitter to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.[2] With huge impact from often biased media, general public is often mislead by the media, and then we start to see suprises after elections. The presidency of Donald Trump began at noon EST on January 20, 2017, Among the 44 persons who have served as president, only Donald Trump had never held a position in either government or the military prior to taking office. In contrast to the 2016 presidential election, where social media was a novelty, the candidates for election in 2020 had carefully managed social media strategies. With the concerns of all those mysterious, we start a study using social media data to analyze current dem candidates status, and help people to understand the 2020 presidential polls. We use social media like youtube, twitter, facebook to address the impact of social media in the 2020 United States presidential election. 1.3 Project 1.3.1 The Team Haibo Yu - hy2628 Kevin Gao - wg2311 1.3.2 The Plan Haibo: 1. Data collecting: Wrote a python script to do the web scraping work for youtube, facebook, twitter. 2. Data preprocessing: Clean up missing data, unified data and merge into csv. 3. Data analysis: Data exploration and visualization Kevin: 1. Data pipeline: Design, and architect the data flow and project details. 2. Data analysis: Data exploration and visualization 3. Data prediction*: Apply machine learning, NLP, GLM to make predictions of our data. 1.3.3 The Questions Here are main questions that we hope we will be able to answer from this research. 1.3.3.0.0.1 Core questions: In each state, which candidate has more popularity online, in terms of views, likes, retweets…etc ? For each candidate, in which state he/she has more popularity online, in terms of views, likes, retweets…etc ? In general, which candidate has more popularity online ? 1.3.3.0.0.2 Potentially, we would like to answer these questions: Who is more concentrating on what topics ? Who is more popular in near future ? Is our result correlating to the final election result in December ? 1.4 References [1] Pollard, Timothy D.; Chesebro, James W.; Studinski, David Paul (2009). “The Role of the Internet in Presidential Campaigns”.

["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Youtbe 2.2 Twitter 2.3 Facebook", " Chapter 2 Data sources We conduct study around 3 social meida platform: Youtube, Twiter, Facebook. Our data source is original, collected from social meida networks, including youtube, facebook, twitter. Methodology: We wrote a python script (web crawler) to do the web scraping work to collect data. Obstacle: There certainly many obstacles in a project, however, here is an interesting one, when we were scraping search result data from youtube for each candidate, we faced with obstacles when grabing the full data from the lazy loading result page, which would hide large content and load those later by user scrolling down to the bottom of the page, this actually prevented us to rely on the initial html dom to scrap the full data. And it’s hard to use web scrawler in python to control the lazy loading behavior. Solution: After serveral attempts, we have resolved this by using a walk-around solution provided in youtube search feature, by adding a paramter ‘&amp;page=N’ (N is the number you would like to paginate) to laod all search result at once, then we can scrap the data page by page. 2.1 Youtbe We use a python script to scape the data, generated csvs and details listed below: 2.1.1 Video df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/2019-12-12.csv&quot;) head(df) ## index candidate state ## 1 0 Donald Trump Alabama ## 2 1 Donald Trump Alabama ## 3 2 Donald Trump Alabama ## 4 3 Donald Trump Alabama ## 5 4 Donald Trump Alabama ## 6 5 Donald Trump Alabama ## title ## 1 President Trump, Melania Trump Attend Alabama Football Game ## 2 Trump Keeps Lying About Hurricane Dorian and Alabama: A Closer Look ## 3 Donald Trump given huge ovation at Alabama/LSU ## 4 Donald Trump displays Hurricane Dorian map apparently doctored with marker pen ## 5 Why Is President Donald Trump Still Fixated On Alabama? | Velshi &amp; Ruhle | MSNBC ## 6 Baby Trump comes to Tuscaloosa for Alabama vs. LSU ## media view time ## 1 VOA News 269,941 11/10/19 ## 2 Late Night with Seth Meyers 3,538,632 9/6/19 ## 3 Alabama Crimson Tide on AL.com 194,856 11/9/19 ## 4 Guardian News 151,199 9/5/19 ## 5 MSNBC 62,441 9/6/19 ## 6 AL.com 128,608 11/9/19 ## description ## 1 President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attended an American football game in Alabama, Saturday, November 9. ## 2 Seth takes a closer look at President Trump defending his doctored map showing Hurricane Dorian hitting Alabama.
