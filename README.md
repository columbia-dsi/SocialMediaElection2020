## Social Media Election 2020

*EDAV Fall 2019 Final Project: Understanding 2020 Presidential Polls from Social Media Perspective.*

### Background

The use of social media in politics including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube has dramatically changed the way campaigns are run and how Americans interact with their elected officials. The prevalence of social media in politics has made elected officials and candidates more accountable and accessible to voters.

Thus we teke a look at social media data and analyze with demographics data collected online to help us understand 2020 Presidential Polls.

### Approaches
