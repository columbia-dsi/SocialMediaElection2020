### Quick Start

- 1. Checkout this repo.

- 2. Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to version 0.16 (2019-11-22).

- 3. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- 4. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- 5. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)

### Set up your own GitHub Pages

- 1. On the home page of your repo, click Settings. Scroll down to the GitHub pages section and change **Source** to **master branch /docs folder**.  Above the **Source** line, a bar will appear with your book's URL. The bar will initially be blue and indicate that your book is *ready* to be published and will change to green once it is published. Copy the URL. (Note that sometimes there is a delay until your book actually appears at that URL. If it doesn't appear after a few minutes, try making a small change locally, rendering the book, and pushing the changes to trigger a deploy.)

- 2. Click the edit button on the top of the home page of the repo and paste your book URL into the **Website** field that appears on the right.

At some point before you turn in your project, delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project with a link to the book URL.
