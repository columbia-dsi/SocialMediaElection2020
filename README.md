## Social Media Election 2020

*EDAV Fall 2019 Final Project: Understanding 2020 Presidential Polls from Social Media Perspective.*


### Background

The use of social media in politics including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube has dramatically changed the way campaigns are run and how Americans interact with their elected officials. The prevalence of social media in politics has made elected officials and candidates more accountable and accessible to voters.

Every adult citizen can vote and every vote counts, the question is: who will be the collaborative decision in this world of divergent?
